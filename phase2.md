# Phase II: User Requirements and Application Specifications


## Chosen Development Model

We have chosen the Agile development model due to its flexibility and adaptability. It aligns well with modern software development needs. Unlike traditional plan-driven models, Agile supports incremental development, enabling software to be constructed and released in small, functional segments. This provides continuous feedback from stakeholders, ensuring that the evolving product meets their expectations. Agile is very effective for projects where requirements are uncertain, subject to frequent changes, or require close customer involvement. It also offers a simple design and reduces the time of delivering the software product to the market.
